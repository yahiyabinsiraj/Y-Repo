# Y-Repo

# Welcome to my ever first shell script designed to automate some commands on John the Ripper

# John the Ripper is a free Linux tool to crack passwords of several files like archives, user passwords etc. with the help of hashfile generated by the tool itself

# The password cracking is generally based on wordlist attack in which a wordlist contains several passwords used in common and the passwords reported that they are being used recently

# Instead of manually running the commands, I have made a shell script that automates that commands in background.

# This shell script basically was developed to crack .zip files

# All you have to do is to specify the directory of the zip file, followed by specifying the directory of the wordlist file present after the prompt.

# Note: - 
     # Specify the path along with the name of the archive
     # Never specify the path with other obsolete characters
     # "Drag n' Drop" the files over the terminal won't work. The script throws an error.
